# Novel-Song-Recognition

Novel implementation for 'Song Recognition using Peaks Generated by STFT'.
This is a Project for IT-204 Signals and Systems course, done by three 2nd Year IT B-Tech students:

- Abhay Aniruddha
- Abhay Lejith
- Nandan Ramesh.

Steps to run :

1. Copy all your songs into the `Songs` folder. This serves as the dataset.
2. Run `preprocessing.py` first to generate the databases in the `Database` folder.
3. Run `master_matcher.py` to obtain an interactive interface.
