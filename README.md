# Novel-Song-Recognition

Novel ideas only.
This is a Project for IT-204 Signals and Systems course, done by three 2nd Year IT B-Tech students:

- Abhay Aniruddha
- Abhay Lejith
- Nandan Ramesh.

Steps to run :

1. Copy all your songs into the 'Songs' folder. This serves as the dataset.
2. Run 'preprocessing.py' first to generate the databases in the 'Database' folder.
3. Run the file you want based on nature of output required :
   - 'matcher1.py' -> To just primitively match the songs.
   - 'matcher1.py' -> To score each match and display the top 5 matches.
   - 'matcher1.py' -> To Generate and display a histogram for the top 5 matches.
   - 'matcher1.py' -> To Display the top matched song and play the song.

Kindly go through the 'Steps' folder to view how the preprocessing works.
